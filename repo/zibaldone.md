## Zibaldone
* [Repo](http://github/damko/zibaldone)
* [Website]()
* Type: web application


### Description and aims of the project:
The project should recreate the concept of [Zibaldone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book#Zibaldone) so it should be able to use chunks of markdown text, either local or living remote, to create html books.
The skeleton of the final book should respect Leanpub specifics so that the book can be published on Leanpub.

### Technologies / Languages / Frameworks in use:

* PHP
* Slim Framework
* AngularJs
* Bootstrap
* Twig

### Technical notes:

The application will be developed with AngularJS on the client/UI side, in PHP on the server side. PHP will provide a REST service.

### Status:

The application is currently working and can produce books but it doesn't allow yet the editing of the fragments from the UI
