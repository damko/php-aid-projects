## Zibaldone
* [Repo](http://github/damko/zibaldone)
* [Website]()
* Type: web application


### Description and aims of the project:
The project should mimic a [Zibaldone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book#Zibaldone) book so it should be able to use chunks of markdown text, either local or remote, to create html books.
The skeleton of the final book should respect Leanpub specifics so that the book can be published on Leanpub. **watch the demo [here](http://youtu.be/lePHPhFQQwI)**

### Technologies / Languages / Frameworks in use:

* PHP
* Slim Framework
* AngularJs
* Bootstrap
* Twig

### Technical notes:

The application will be developed with AngularJS on the client/UI side, in PHP on the server side. PHP will provide a REST service.

### Status:

Alpha. The application is currently working and can produce books but it doesn't allow yet the editing of the fragments from the UI. It misses tests. It started as a self tutorial for AngularJs but it turns to be quite interesting.
